# Annapurna Base Camp (ABC) Trek (2025 Guide)

&#x20;The Annapurna Base Camp trek immerses hikers in the heart of the *Annapurna Sanctuary*, a high-altitude amphitheatre surrounded by towering peaks.  Trekkers wind through lush bamboo and rhododendron forests and traditional Gurung villages, eventually emerging at ABC (4,130 m) with 360° views of giants like Annapurna I (8,091 m), Hiunchuli and Machhapuchhare.  Over 7–12 days (often \~10 days) the trail gradually gains elevation.  The hike is **moderately challenging** – longer than short hill treks but less extreme than the big expeditions – so a reasonable fitness level and acclimatization are important.  As one guide notes, ABC “has what it takes to excite, amaze, and dazzle you,” and is suitable for **both experienced hikers and first-timers** seeking a rewarding Himalayan adventure.

The trail to ABC is well-maintained (stone steps, teahouses) but still involves long days – typically **6–8 hours of hiking per day over varied terrain**.  Overall the trek is rated moderate, suitable for anyone in good health.  (The total distance is \~110 km round-trip.) With proper pacing and an early start each day, most trekkers of average fitness complete it without technical mountaineering skills.

## Logistics and Planning

* **Best Seasons:**  The prime trekking windows are **Spring (Mar–May)** and **Autumn (Sep–Nov)**.  In spring the weather is mild and the hillsides bloom with rhododendrons.  In autumn the monsoon has cleared, leaving stable weather and *crystal-clear skies* ideal for mountain views. (Summer monsoon (Jun–Aug) brings heavy rains and is generally avoided.)
* **Duration:**  Most trekkers plan **7–12 days** for the round-trip.  Common itineraries are \~9–10 days, allowing time for acclimatization and optional side trips. (Shortest guided packages squeeze it into 5–7 days, but that’s very rapid.)
* **Trailhead & Route:**  The trek begins in the Annapurna region of Gandaki Province.  You typically start from **Nayapul** (or Kimche) – a small roadhead reached by a 1.5-hour drive or bus ride from Pokhara.  For example, public buses leave Pokhara’s Baglung Station and reach Nayapul in \~1.5 hr.  The return trek follows the same trail back to Nayapul (or nearby Birethanti), where vehicles transport you to Pokhara.  Some itineraries include a short drive to a further trailhead (e.g. Ulleri or Tikhedhunga) to save a day.
* **Maximum Elevation:** Annapurna Base Camp itself is at **4,130 m (13,550 ft)**, which is the highest point of the trek.  (A common side trip is to **Machapuchare Base Camp** at \~3,700 m, which provides great views of Machhapuchhare, the “Fishtail” peak.)

## Required Permits and Fees

Foreign trekkers must obtain conservation permits to enter the Annapurna region. As of 2025, the key permits are:

* **ACAP (Annapurna Conservation Area Permit):** NPR **3,000** for foreign nationals (valid for one month).  This mandatory permit funds conservation in the Annapurna Conservation Area.  (Citizens of SAARC countries pay less; Nepali citizens NPR 100.)
* **TIMS Card (Trekkers’ Information Management System):** *No longer required for ABC.*  (Until 2023, foreign trekkers also needed a TIMS card (about NPR 2,000) in Nepal, but trekking authorities dropped this requirement for Annapurna routes.)
* **Permits Issuance:** Both ACAP and (formerly) TIMS can be obtained at the Nepal Tourism Board (NTB) offices in **Kathmandu** or **Pokhara**.  In Kathmandu, go to the NTB permit office (Bhrikutimandap, Thamel). In Pokhara, the NTB office at the Immigration Office (Damside, Lakeside) issues permits.  Plan to get these before heading into the hills (e.g. on the way to Pokhara).

*Note:* No additional restricted-area permits are needed for the standard ABC trek (unlike Mustang or Nar Phu). Just carry your passport when trekking, as checkpoints may verify your permit or identity.

## Sample 10-Day Itinerary

Below is a **typical 10-day ABC trek** outline (there are many variants; this one includes Ghorepani/Poon Hill and Machapuchare Base Camp). Distances and times are approximate:

1. **Day 1:** Drive from Pokhara to Nayapul (1,070 m), trek to Tikhedhunga (1,540 m) or directly to Ulleri (2,070 m). (Walking ≈5–6 hr.)  Climb the famous stone stairway out of Tikhedhunga if you start lower.
2. **Day 2:** Trek from Ulleri up to **Ghorepani** (2,860 m) in \~6 hr.  This is a steep climb through forest.  Ghorepani is a large teahouse village.
3. **Day 3:** Pre-dawn hike to **Poon Hill** (3,210 m) for sunrise over the Himalaya (Annapurna, Dhaulagiri, Fishtail views). Return to Ghorepani, then trek on (\~4–5 hr) to **Tadapani** (2,620 m).
4. **Day 4:** Tadapani to **Chhomrong** (1,970 m) – descend into the Modi Khola valley and cross suspension bridges to reach Chhomrong village. (≈5–6 hr.)  Chhomrong is a major Gurung village and base for upper trails.
5. **Day 5:** Chhomrong to **Dovan** (2,600 m).  The trail climbs via Bamboo and Nangethanti to Dovan lodge (a simple teahouse). You can add an optional side trip today to **Machapuchare Base Camp (MBC)** (\~3,700 m) for close views of Fishtail Mountain, or save it for the next day. (≈5–6 hr.)
6. **Day 6:** *(If not done on Day 5)* Trek to Machapuchare Base Camp (3,700 m), then back down to **Himalaya (Deurali)** or continue to Annapurna Base Camp. Many itineraries spend the night at MBC to catch sunrise on Machapuchare. (Dovan → MBC ≈4 hr, then camp.)
7. **Day 7:** **Sunrise hike to Annapurna Base Camp (4,130 m)** – arrive in time for sunrise if possible. Soak in the panoramic view of the Annapurna Sanctuary. After lunch at ABC, descend to **Bamboo (2,310 m)** or Himalaya (≈6–8 hr).
8. **Day 8:** Bamboo to **Jhinu Danda** (1,760 m) – descend through lower forests and villages. In Jhinu, take an (optional) hot spring bath in the Modi Khola river. (≈4–5 hr.)
9. **Day 9:** Jhinu Danda to **Nayapul** (1,070 m), then drive or bus back to Pokhara (830 m). (≈4–5 hr walking, then 1–2 hr drive.)
10. **Day 10:** Reserve this as a buffer or departure day. Trekkers often fly/bus from Pokhara to Kathmandu this day, or use it to rest after the trek.

This itinerary names key villages and landmarks: *Ghorepani* (gateway to Poon Hill), *Poon Hill*, *Tadapani*, *Chhomrong*, *Machapuchare Base Camp* and of course *Annapurna Base Camp*.  Note that daily hiking times can vary by individual pace; always allow extra time for breaks and photography.

## Accommodation and Food

* **Teahouse Lodges:** Along the trail you stay in simple guesthouses (“tea houses”). These typically offer dormitory-style rooms (2–4 beds per room) or twin rooms, with shared bathroom facilities. Expect basic comforts: wooden beds with heavy blankets, cold water taps, and communal dining areas heated by a wood stove.  Electricity and Wi-Fi (where available) cost extra, and hot showers are rare (or extra-fee bucket showers).  Plan to bring a good sleeping bag liner (or sleeping bag) and a small towel.  Teahouse fees (NPR \~200–500) often allow you to charge phones at night.
* **Food & Meals:** Every village teahouse serves a standard menu of Nepali and Indian-style food. Common items include:

  * **Dal-bhat** (rice with lentil soup, vegetables and pickles) – the staple Nepali meal.  It’s very filling (often *unlimited refills* on rice and curry) and packed with carbs/protein.
  * **Noodles/Chow-mein** – fried noodles with veggies (optional eggs or meat).
  * **Thukpa or Soups** – warm noodle or veggie soups, great at cold nights.
  * **Momos** – Tibetan-style dumplings (vegetable or meat) with spicy sauce.
  * **Breakfast items**: pancakes, porridge/oatmeal, eggs, toast.  (Many trekkers also snack on energy bars, nuts and fruit.)
  * **Snacks & Drinks**: Herbal teas (e.g. lemongrass, ginger), hot chocolate, coffee cake, biscuits, and local snacks like roasted corn.
    Most food is cooked from local ingredients, and vegetables can be scarce at higher altitudes (expect simple mountain veggies).  Vegetarian options are available (vegetable dal-bhat is common).  Carry some cash (NPR) to pay for meals and incidentals (about NPR 2,000–3,000 per day is typical for 3 meals plus tips and hot drinks).  Overall, the teahouse culture is very friendly – you’ll dine together with fellow trekkers and share stories after the day’s hike.

## Safety and Health

* **Altitude Sickness (AMS):** The route climbs from \~1,000 m to over 4,000 m, so acclimatization is critical.  Above \~2,400 m (8,000 ft) the risk of AMS rises sharply.  Ascend gradually: follow “climb high, sleep low” where possible, and **limit daily gain to \~300–500 m once above 3,000 m**.  Schedule at least one rest day or easy day (for example, in Chhomrong or Dovan) to adjust.  Drink plenty of water and eat well.  Know AMS symptoms (headache, nausea, fatigue, dizziness) and **descend immediately if they worsen**.  Many trekkers carry diamox (acetazolamide) and first-aid for altitude, but the best “treatment” is acclimatizing and not overexerting.
* **General Safety:** Mountain trails can be slippery (especially in the rainy season), and landslides occur in monsoon. Always wear sturdy boots and take care on narrow paths. A trekking pole can help with balance on steep sections. Check weather each morning; avoid trekking in heavy fog or monsoon storms. Join a group or hire a guide/porter if needed (even though guides are not mandatory on ABC, a local guide adds safety and logistic support).
* **Travel Insurance:** A **comprehensive travel/trekking insurance** policy is *essential*. It should cover high-altitude helicopter rescue and emergency evacuation (medical and rescue costs can be very high in the Himalaya). Many local operators explicitly advise getting insurance with helicopter rescue cover. Always keep emergency funds and insurance details accessible. In Nepal you will fill out a Trekker Information form; save copies of your permits and insurance when trekking.

Staying well-prepared (physical training ahead of time, carrying layers of warm clothing, sunscreen, first-aid supplies, and water purification tablets) will make your ABC trek safer and more enjoyable. With the right precautions, the Annapurna Base Camp trek is an unforgettable and manageable adventure for fit hikers, offering stunning rewards at every step.
